This week in ruma-events' Google Summer of Code project, I was able to finish the macros needed to generate the event content enums and trait implementations required for events. I started by defining the [generic event structs](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/107) (state, message, etc.) and manually writing the `Serialize` and `Deserialize` implementations. Over the next few days, this was moved into a custom derive macro called [`Event`](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/108). The derive now implements all necessary traits with appropriate bounds, so a `StateEvent<C>` can not contain any ephemeral event content and so forth. I have removed the [`raw`](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/111) mod and related `FromRaw` and `TryFromRaw` traits, moving the validation into the deserialization and constructor for the few types that needed it. On the [event content](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/106) side of things, a function like procedural macro was used to allow declaring the enum using Matrix event type identifiers.
```rust
event_content_enum! {
    /// Any message event.
    name: AnyMessageEventContent,
    events: [
        "m.call.answer",
        "m.room.message",
        // ...
    ]
}
// Produces
pub enum AnyMessageEventContent {
    CallAnswer(CallAnswerEventContent),
    RoomMessage(MessageEventContent),
}
```
