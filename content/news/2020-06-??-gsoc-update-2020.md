What a busy week! The ruma homeserver repo was replaced by a monorepo to house all the ruma crates. The 0.22 release of ruma-events will be merged any day now. With Jonas's help and patients, we have made excellent progress! The event kinds are all defined! Using a custom derive to implement the necessary traits for serialization/deserialization they are ready to be sent and received! All but redaction and presence events have a generic content field with a trait bound limiting the field to only valid content types.
```rust
#[derive(..., StateEventContent)]
pub struct AliasEventContent {
    alias: RoomAliasId,
}

pub enum AnyStateEventContent {
    RoomAlias(AliasEventContent),
    RoomAvatar(AvatarEventContent),
    // ... and so on
}

pub struct MessageEvent<C: MessageEventContent> {
    pub content: C,
    // ...
}

pub struct StateEvent<C: StateEventContent> {
    pub content: C,
    // ...
}

pub enum AnyRoomEvent {
    /// Any message event.
    Message(MessageEvent<AnyMessageEventContent>),
    /// `"m.room.redaction"`, on of the non generic event structs.
    Redaction(RedactionEvent),
    /// Any state event.
    State(StateEvent<AnyStateEventContent>),
}
```

Jonas started moving ruma-events into ruma/ruma today (10-06-2020) ðŸŽ‰! Lets hope all goes smoothly.
