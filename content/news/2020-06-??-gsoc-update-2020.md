What a busy week! The ruma homeserver repo was replaced by a monorepo to house all the ruma crates. The 0.22 release of ruma-events will be merged any day now. With Jonas's help and patience, we have made excellent progress! The event kinds (state, message, ephemeral, etc.) are all defined! Using a custom derive macro to implement the necessary traits for serialization/deserialization they are ready to be sent and received! All but redaction and presence events have a generic content field with a trait bound limiting the field to only valid content types.
```rust
#[derive(..., StateEventContent)]
pub struct AliasEventContent { // This impl's StateEventContent.
    alias: RoomAliasId,
}

pub enum AnyStateEventContent { // This also impl's StateEventContent.
    RoomAlias(AliasEventContent),
    // ... all state events
}

pub struct StateEvent<C: StateEventContent> {
    pub content: C,
    // ... all other state event fields
}

pub enum AnyRoomEvent {
    Message(MessageEvent<AnyMessageEventContent>), /// Any message event, this is defined like StateEvent.
    State(StateEvent<AnyStateEventContent>),
    Redaction(RedactionEvent), // RedactionEvent has only one valid content so it isn't generic.
}
```

Jonas started moving ruma-events into ruma/ruma today (10-06-2020) ðŸŽ‰! A few hours later, he was done now. It's time to test it out in clients, let's hope all goes well.
