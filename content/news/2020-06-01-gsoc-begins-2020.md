Thanks to GSoC and the continued help of Jonas Platte, Ruma's GSoC mentor, there is a new contributor... me! My name is Devin Ragotzy, a University student from Michigan. I was chosen to help contribute to the macro code of ruma-events and ruma-api. Before the official coding period began on June 1st, a large breaking change started taking shape for the upcoming release of ruma-events [0.22.0](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/issues/82). Jonas, I, and others have been hard at work, replacing the previous event declaration macro with a set of derive macros and generic event types, as well as getting rid of the boilerplate required for event enums (the types currently found under `ruma_events::collections`). The new types will be able to express JSON events from a Matrix server with more accuracy.

## Planned work for ruma-api

Once the macros in ruma-events are implemented, I will switch gears to work on ruma-api.
- First, add a few tests to ensure the changes I make do not break important functionality
  - Test macro code using `macrotest` and/or `trybuild` which test errors or expansions respectively
- Allow more code sharing between `Request` and `Response` processing inside the macro
- Refactor `ruma_api!` breaking up the large block of code in `Api::to_tokens`
- Document any refactored or new code as I work
