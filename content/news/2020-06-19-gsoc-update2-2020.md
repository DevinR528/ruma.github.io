This week in ruma-events' Google Summer of Code project, after trying out the new API in [`matrix-rust-sdk`](https://github.com/DevinR528/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2), we found a few fatal flaws. There was no easy way to go from `StateEvent<AnyStateEventContent>` to `StateEvent<SpecificEventContent>`, the other issue was one could create a `StateEvent` with differing `content` and `prev_content` fields using the `AnyStateEventContent` enum. The [new API](https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/68) will be similar to the old one, each event kind (state, message, ephemeral, etc.) is represented by an enum.
```rust
pub enum AnyStateEvent {
    RoomMember(StateEvent<MemberEventContent>),
    RoomAliases(StateEvent<RoomAliases>),
    // ...
}
```
There were a few minor fixes during the week also. Unknown field deserialization is [fixed](https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/57), allowing deserialization of a JSON blob that has extra fields which are ignored. [Custom events](https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/59) are now present in the `Any*EventContent` enums, although now they have to be moved up to be included in `Any*Event` enums. [Benchmarks](https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/52) for deserialization have been added and used to increase performance.
