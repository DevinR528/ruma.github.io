## From the editor

I forgot to provide an update last week, so this week we've got two weeks of stuff to cover.
The revamp of ruma-events I mentioned several times previously was released as [0.13.0](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/releases/tag/0.13.0), followed shortly by an update to [0.14.0](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/releases/tag/0.14.0) to bump the url crate (which is a re-exported dependency) to version 2.0.
When trying to integrate the new ruma-events into ruma-client-api, [Jonas](https://github.com/jplatte) quickly discovered that it wasn't actually possible, because API requests/responses that contain events need to be deserialized, and can't because the events don't have a public implementation of `serde::Deserialize` anymore.
I felt like an idiot for not foreseeing this seemingly obvious problem, but that's the way it goes sometimes.
I'll be working on addressing this next week.

A new version of ruma-api, [0.10.0](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/releases/tag/ruma-api-0.10.0), was released this week.
This release contains two significant changes:
The first is that the `Endpoint` trait has been revised to be implemented in terms of the endpoint's request type, rather than having the request be specified via an associated type.
This creates a more straightforward mapping between request and response types for each endpoint, removes a bunch of unnecessary unit structs that were only used to link associated request and response types together, and lets us remove some use of the turbofish operator in ruma-client.
The second change in this release is that ruma-api-macros has been merged into the repo, and now exists in a Cargo workspace.
The `ruma_api` procedural macro is now included and re-export from ruma-api itself under a default feature.
The macro has also been updated to refer to its dependencies via a hidden module in ruma-api.
The result is that downstream crates like ruma-client-api no longer have to specify dependnecies on all the crates referenced by the code generated by the macro.

Another exiciting update:
This past week, both Jonas and I started live streaming our development on Twitch.
I made a [separate post on my own blog](https://www.jimmycuadra.com/posts/twitch-live-streams-of-ruma-development/) about this, but the short version is that I intend to live stream most of my work on Ruma from now on to help people learn about both Rust and Matrix.
You can find my live streams on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/jimmycuadra), and you can watch the recordings of past streams on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnflGGv5ZM2kdn9RPb2NG6Q).
I'll announce my streams in [#ruma:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#ruma:matrix.org) as well as on [my Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/jimmycuadra).
Jonas's live streams can be watched on [his Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/jplatte).

In the last update, I mentioned that Ruma finally [accepts donations via Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/ruma/).
Thank you very much to the people who have already signed on to donate to the project!
I thought it wouldn't hurt to mention again in case anyone missed it. :}
