<strong>Ruma</strong> is a set of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> library crates for working with the <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a> protocol. Matrix is an open specification for an online communication protocol. For an overview of the project, visit the <a href="/">home page</a>.
<strong>This Week in Ruma</strong> is a weekly summary of the development of Ruma, published on Sunday nights.

<h2 id="from-the-editor">From the editor</h2>

<p>I forgot to provide an update last week, so this week we've got two weeks of stuff to cover.
The revamp of ruma-events I mentioned several times previously was released as <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/releases/tag/0.13.0">0.13.0</a>, followed shortly by an update to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/releases/tag/0.14.0">0.14.0</a> to bump the url crate (which is a re-exported dependency) to version 2.0.
When trying to integrate the new ruma-events into ruma-client-api, <a href="https://github.com/jplatte">Jonas</a> quickly discovered that it wasn't actually possible, because API requests/responses that contain events need to be deserialized, and can't because the events don't have a public implementation of <code>serde::Deserialize</code> anymore.
I felt like an idiot for not foreseeing this seemingly obvious problem, but that's the way it goes sometimes.
I'll be working on addressing this next week.</p>

<p>A new version of ruma-api, <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/releases/tag/ruma-api-0.10.0">0.10.0</a>, was released this week.
This release contains two significant changes:
The first is that the <code>Endpoint</code> trait has been revised to be implemented in terms of the endpoint's request type, rather than having the request be specified via an associated type.
This creates a more straightforward mapping between request and response types for each endpoint, removes a bunch of unnecessary unit structs that were only used to link associated request and response types together, and lets us remove some use of the turbofish operator in ruma-client.
The second change in this release is that ruma-api-macros has been merged into the repo, and now exists in a Cargo workspace.
The <code>ruma_api</code> procedural macro is now included and re-export from ruma-api itself under a default feature.
The macro has also been updated to refer to its dependencies via a hidden module in ruma-api.
The result is that downstream crates like ruma-client-api no longer have to specify dependnecies on all the crates referenced by the code generated by the macro.</p>

<p>Another exiciting update:
This past week, both Jonas and I started live streaming our development on Twitch.
I made a <a href="https://www.jimmycuadra.com/posts/twitch-live-streams-of-ruma-development/">separate post on my own blog</a> about this, but the short version is that I intend to live stream most of my work on Ruma from now on to help people learn about both Rust and Matrix.
You can find my live streams on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jimmycuadra">my Twitch channel</a>, and you can watch the recordings of past streams on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnflGGv5ZM2kdn9RPb2NG6Q">my YouTube channel</a>.
I'll announce my streams in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruma:matrix.org">#ruma:matrix.org</a> as well as on <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmycuadra">my Twitter feed</a>.
Jonas's live streams can be watched on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jplatte">his Twitch channel</a>.</p>

<p>In the last update, I mentioned that Ruma finally <a href="https://liberapay.com/ruma/">accepts donations via Liberapay</a>.
Thank you very much to the people who have already signed on to donate to the project!
I thought it wouldn't hurt to mention again in case anyone missed it. :}</p>
