<p>On Friday, I live streamed myself working on Ruma for the first time.
I tweeted about it from my <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmycuadra">personal account</a> and mentioned it in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruma:matrix.org">#ruma:matrix.org</a>, but otherwise didn't publicize it.
A few people watched and helped work out the kinks with audio and video quality.
(Thank you to those who watched!)
I walked through the API endpoint for creating message events, explaining more or less line by line how the code works, then worked on implementing the API endpoint for creating state events.
The people who watched gave me good feedback, and I had a good time doing it, so I think I'll start to stream some of my Ruma development regularly.
It will be at 1:00 PM Pacific Time on my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jimmy_cuadra">Twitch channel</a>.
I will start tweeting about it from <a href="https://twitter.com/ruma_io">Ruma's Twitter account</a> to remind everyone.
I'd love to get some questions during the stream, so if you're interested in learning about Matrix, Rust, or both, please come watch and tell me what you want to know!</p>

<h2 id="notable-changes-to-rumahttpsgithubcomrumaruma">Notable changes to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">ruma</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Added initial support for the state event creation API endpoint.</li>
  <li>Filled in missing functionality and fixed a few issues with the room alias API endpoints, which checks those off the list completely.</li>
  <li>A new contributor is working on the API endpoint for joining a room, and in the process added a new Iron middleware for extracting a <code>ruma_identifiers::RoomId</code> from the URL path parameter wherever it's required.</li>
  <li>A small quality of life fix: <code>script/cargo</code> now passed the value of <code>RUST_LOG</code> to the Docker environment when developing.</li>
  <li>The project's README now includes some more information about how to determine which version of nightly Rust Ruma is built against for those not using Docker for development.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apologies for the lack of updates the last two weeks!
Two weeks ago I had family visiting over the weekend and last weekend I was in Portland for the first ever RustConf, which was fantastic!</p>

<p>In addition to the changes below, I've been working on transaction support for the message event creation API.
It looks like it's going to require a few features that are not yet supported by Diesel: <code>SET TRANSACTION</code> and tables with composite primary keys.
These are already on the roadmap for Diesel, so more progress will be made on this front soon.</p>

<h2 id="notable-changes-to-rumahttpsgithubcomrumaruma">Notable changes to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">ruma</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Some changes to error handling to be more ergonomic, provide better user-facing error messages, and to follow Rust conventions better.</li>
  <li>Added information to the project's README about how to develop without Docker.</li>
  <li>Added integration tests for the message event creation API, which uncovered a bug that is now fixed.</li>
  <li>The room alias creation API now correctly returns a 409 HTTP status code if the alias already exists.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Talked with Niko Matsakis at RustConf and concluded that the functionality proposed in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1546">RFC 1546</a> will be necessary for ruma-events to define the different kinds of Matrix events as traits instead of structs.
I added a somewhat rambly explanation of this in the comments on the RFC.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="matrix-at-large">Matrix at large</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The Matrix client Vector has come out of beta and has been rebranded as <a href="https://riot.im/">Riot</a>!
End-to-end encrypted messages are finally here!</li>

<p>Recently, types from the ruma-identifiers crate were integrated into ruma-events and ruma, so that values representing a Matrix ID can guarantee some important invariants.
Previously these values were just strings.
There was still a source of confusion and errors in that the ID types had to be converted to and from strings for the structs that represent database records using the Diesel ORM.
To fix this, I added the necessary implementations to ruma-identifiers (under the "diesel" feature) so that the ID types can serve directly as the database columns' data types.
Of course, these are still stored as text in the database, but the conversion happens only during data serialization and deserialization, and so cannot be broken by application logic.
This was a pretty hairy change and it took a while to get it all working and to get the test suite updated and passing.
Big thanks to Sean Griffin (author of Diesel) for helping me figure out how to achieve this.</p>

<h2 id="notable-changes-to-rumahttpsgithubcomrumaruma">Notable changes to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">ruma</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Increase the portability of the Cargo wrapper script.</li>
  <li>Use ruma-identifiers ID types for relevant database columns.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Crate version 0.4.0 and then 0.4.1 were released, adding Diesel integration and a bug fix for case-sensitivity in user IDs.</li>

  <li>Sean Griffin shared <a href="https://gist.github.com/sgrif/92809819185a4077e919aaf0a607c6ef">some details</a> of generic implementations that don't work right now, but ideally could help make it easier for apps to create their own custom Diesel data types.</li>
  <li>An important step for the future prospects of moving Ruma to stable Rust, the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/35957">implementation for macros 1.1</a> will land soon.
This will allow Diesel and Serde to use custom derive without requiring nightly features, which is one of the main reasons Ruma targets nightly Rust.</li>
