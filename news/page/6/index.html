            <p>Apologies for the lack of updates the last two weeks!
Two weeks ago I had family visiting over the weekend and last weekend I was in Portland for the first ever RustConf, which was fantastic!</p>
<p>In addition to the changes below, I've been working on transaction support for the message event creation API.
It looks like it's going to require a few features that are not yet supported by Diesel: <code>SET TRANSACTION</code> and tables with composite primary keys.
These are already on the roadmap for Diesel, so more progress will be made on this front soon.</p>
<h2 id="notable-changes-to-ruma">Notable changes to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">ruma</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Some changes to error handling to be more ergonomic, provide better user-facing error messages, and to follow Rust conventions better.</li>
<li>Added information to the project's README about how to develop without Docker.</li>
<li>Added integration tests for the message event creation API, which uncovered a bug that is now fixed.</li>
<li>The room alias creation API now correctly returns a 409 HTTP status code if the alias already exists.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Talked with Niko Matsakis at RustConf and concluded that the functionality proposed in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1546">RFC 1546</a> will be necessary for ruma-events to define the different kinds of Matrix events as traits instead of structs.
I added a somewhat rambly explanation of this in the comments on the RFC.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="matrix-at-large">Matrix at large</h2>

<li>The Matrix client Vector has come out of beta and has been rebranded as <a href="https://riot.im/">Riot</a>!
End-to-end encrypted messages are finally here!</li>

            <p>Recently, types from the ruma-identifiers crate were integrated into ruma-events and ruma, so that values representing a Matrix ID can guarantee some important invariants.
Previously these values were just strings.
There was still a source of confusion and errors in that the ID types had to be converted to and from strings for the structs that represent database records using the Diesel ORM.
To fix this, I added the necessary implementations to ruma-identifiers (under the &quot;diesel&quot; feature) so that the ID types can serve directly as the database columns' data types.
Of course, these are still stored as text in the database, but the conversion happens only during data serialization and deserialization, and so cannot be broken by application logic.
This was a pretty hairy change and it took a while to get it all working and to get the test suite updated and passing.
Big thanks to Sean Griffin (author of Diesel) for helping me figure out how to achieve this.</p>

<li>An important step for the future prospects of moving Ruma to stable Rust, the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/35957">implementation for macros 1.1</a> will land soon.

            <p>Apologies for the missed update last week!
I was sick and didn't get a chance to write it.
However, there was work on the project last week.
I will just include those changes in this update.</p>
<h2 id="notable-changes-to-ruma">Notable changes to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">ruma</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Previous work to update Diesel and Serde to the latest versions have been completed.</li>
<li>Ruma now uses the types from <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-identifiers">ruma-identifiers</a> to represent Matrix IDs instead of strings.</li>
<li>Ruma now uses the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events">ruma-events</a> which also uses ruma-identifiers.</li>
<li>The Docker Compose file now locks the Ruma development image to a specific version, so breaking changes to the image are now coordinated with Ruma.
As part of the same change, the image is now locked to a specific version of the nightly compiler.</li>
<li>Database migrations are now embedded in the ruma binary, which means a check out of the source code is no longer necessary.</li>
<li>Add initial support for the message event creation API.
This is a big milestone and one of the core APIs that makes Matrix work!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-changes-to-ruma-events">Notable changes to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events">ruma-events</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Added simple type aliases for custom events of each kind (basic, room, and state events).</li>
<li>I'm experimenting again with a version of the API where the event kinds are traits instead of generic structs.
They really feel like they should be traits, but the actual usage pattern for the events in the main ruma application may not work well like this.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-changes-to-ruma-identifiers">Notable changes to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-identifiers">ruma-identifiers</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Crate version 0.3.0 was released, which implements <code>Clone</code> for the ID types and <code>Copy</code> for the error type.</li>
<li>I'm working on a change that would allow the ID types to be used directly as struct fields for Diesel table types.
Right now it seems like more trouble than it's worth, but I'm following the issue on <a href="https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/348">user-defined <code>FromSql</code>/<code>ToSql</code> types</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="matrix-at-large">Matrix at large</h2>
<ul>
<li>Paul Evans of the Matrix team is working on testing Ruma with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest">SyTest</a>, a blackbox integration testing framework for Matrix homeservers.
Even though few of the APIs are complete in Ruma so far, there are already a few tests passing!</li>
<li><a href="https://matrix.org/jira/browse/SPEC-442">SPEC-442</a>: Explain requirements and guarantees around transaction IDs</li>
<li><a href="https://matrix.org/jira/browse/SPEC-444">SPEC-444</a>: Add an API for getting auth flows
The May 22, 2016 news update mentioned that Vector and Synapse use unspecified APIs for negotiating authentication flows, but an issue was never filed for improving that.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rust-at-large">Rust at large</h2>
<ul>
<li>Starting to think about how permissions checks will work in Ruma, I opened an issue for <a href="https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/408">transaction isolation support</a> in Diesel as a possible way to prevent ToCToU errors.</li>

            <p>This week I began working on upgrading the libraries used by Ruma.
In particular, Diesel and Serde have new minor versions (which prior to 1.0 are effectively major versions.)
I'm also working on integrating ruma-identifiers and the recent round of changes to ruma-events back into Ruma.
Because of library changes, there are a lot of code updates needed.
I got the compiler errors down from about 60 to about 10, but there are a few blocking issues to fix the rest.
These are noted in the section on Rust below.</p>
<h2 id="notable-changes-to-ruma-events">Notable changes to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events">ruma-events</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Replace macro for enum implementation with more straightforward usage of Serde annotations where possible.
This means that <code>Display</code> and <code>FromStr</code> are no longer implemented for these types, but they may not be used by Ruma anyway.
They'll be added back if and when there is an actual need.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rust-at-large">Rust at large</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/pull/394">diesel-rs/diesel#394</a> Remove the <code>Copy</code> constraint from <code>Identifiable</code>.
In Diesel 0.7.0, struct fields representing a database table's primary key must be <code>Copy</code>.
Because strings are used for this in Ruma, this PR must be merged in order to avoid a bunch of otherwise unnecessary newtypes in Ruma.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/iron/body-parser/pull/72">iron/body-parser#72</a>: Bump Serde to 0.8.
Needed due to version conflicts with <code>serde_json::Value</code>.</li>

            <p>This week <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/releases/tag/v0.8.0">serde 0.8.0</a> was released, offering a new serialization API.
Most of the work on Ruma was towards serialization of the ID and event types.
This will support the next step of implementing APIs in the homeserver that take events as user input.
In addition to the changes landed in ruma-events, I've been working on figuring out how to approach Matrix types that are represented as enums in Rust code but involve checking the value of a key in the JSON structure of the serialized form to determine which variant it is.
I hope to get this nailed down and committed by next week's update.</p>
<h2 id="notable-changes-to-ruma-identifiers">Notable changes to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-identifiers">ruma-identifiers</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Implement serialization and deserialization for ID types.</li>
<li>Change the <code>new</code> constructor to an implementation of <code>TryFrom</code> and add a separate <code>generate</code> constructor for generating new IDs with random localparts.</li>
<li>Begin running the test suite on Travis CI.</li>
<li>Publish the crate to crates.io.
ruma-identifiers is the first Ruma component to get a crates.io release!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-changes-to-ruma-events">Notable changes to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events">ruma-events</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Convert the types of struct fields that represent a Matrix ID from <code>String</code> to the relevant type from ruma-identifiers.</li>
<li>Manually implement serialization and deserialization for a few enum types where the variant name appears in JSON camel cased.
This was initially done by copy/pasting similar code between types, but was replaced with a macro that reduced a lot of duplication (and actually increased the test suite coverage by testing every single variant of each enum.)</li>
<li>Begin running the test suite on Travis CI.</li>
