<p>I did another live stream of Ruma development on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jimmycuadra">my Twitch channel</a> this past week.
If you missed it, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfMvGWCBkVI">the recording on YouTube</a>.
In the stream, I worked on another revision to the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events">ruma-events</a> API in which a special result type was introduced to handle deserialization/validation errors.
<a href="https://github.com/jplatte">Jonas</a> quickly discovered, upon trying to update <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-client-api">ruma-client-api</a> to ruma-events 0.10, that the new deserialization API didn't quite work and that further changes were needed.
I updated all the manually events to the <em>new</em> new API, but the events generated by <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events-macros">ruma-events-macros</a> still need to be updated.
I will do that on the next stream in the coming week.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago I recorded an interview with the <a href="https://rustacean-station.org/">Rustacean Station</a> podcast, and today the episode was released.
You can find it here: <a href="https://rustacean-station.org/episode/001-ruma/">Ruma and the Matrix Communication Protocol: An Interview with Jimmy Cuadra</a>.
A huge thanks to Ben Striegel and Jon Gjengset for starting the podcast, and to Ben and Abdou Seck for taking the time to record this episode with me.
It was a good time, and I hope it gets some new people interested in Matrix and/or Ruma.</p>

<p>I forgot to provide an update last week, so this week we've got two weeks of stuff to cover.
The revamp of ruma-events I mentioned several times previously was released as <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/releases/tag/0.13.0">0.13.0</a>, followed shortly by an update to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/releases/tag/0.14.0">0.14.0</a> to bump the url crate (which is a re-exported dependency) to version 2.0.
When trying to integrate the new ruma-events into ruma-client-api, <a href="https://github.com/jplatte">Jonas</a> quickly discovered that it wasn't actually possible, because API requests/responses that contain events need to be deserialized, and can't because the events don't have a public implementation of <code>serde::Deserialize</code> anymore.
I felt like an idiot for not foreseeing this seemingly obvious problem, but that's the way it goes sometimes.
I'll be working on addressing this next week.</p>

<p>A new version of ruma-api, <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/releases/tag/ruma-api-0.10.0">0.10.0</a>, was released this week.
This release contains two significant changes:
The first is that the <code>Endpoint</code> trait has been revised to be implemented in terms of the endpoint's request type, rather than having the request be specified via an associated type.
This creates a more straightforward mapping between request and response types for each endpoint, removes a bunch of unnecessary unit structs that were only used to link associated request and response types together, and lets us remove some use of the turbofish operator in ruma-client.
The second change in this release is that ruma-api-macros has been merged into the repo, and now exists in a Cargo workspace.
The <code>ruma_api</code> procedural macro is now included and re-export from ruma-api itself under a default feature.
The macro has also been updated to refer to its dependencies via a hidden module in ruma-api.
The result is that downstream crates like ruma-client-api no longer have to specify dependnecies on all the crates referenced by the code generated by the macro.</p>

<p>Another exiciting update:
This past week, both Jonas and I started live streaming our development on Twitch.
I made a <a href="https://www.jimmycuadra.com/posts/twitch-live-streams-of-ruma-development/">separate post on my own blog</a> about this, but the short version is that I intend to live stream most of my work on Ruma from now on to help people learn about both Rust and Matrix.
You can find my live streams on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jimmycuadra">my Twitch channel</a>, and you can watch the recordings of past streams on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnflGGv5ZM2kdn9RPb2NG6Q">my YouTube channel</a>.
I'll announce my streams in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruma:matrix.org">#ruma:matrix.org</a> as well as on <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmycuadra">my Twitter feed</a>.
Jonas's live streams can be watched on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jplatte">his Twitch channel</a>.</p>

<p>In the last update, I mentioned that Ruma finally <a href="https://liberapay.com/ruma/">accepts donations via Liberapay</a>.
Thank you very much to the people who have already signed on to donate to the project!
I thought it wouldn't hurt to mention again in case anyone missed it. :}</p>

<p>This week I'd like to officially welcome <a href="https://github.com/jplatte">Jonas Platte</a> as a member of the Ruma team.
Jonas has been involved in the project for a long time and has provided many significant contributions, both via code and via discussions about the project's design.
Jonas is the original author of ruma-gtk, a graphical Matrix client built on ruma-client, which later became <a href="https://github.com/fest-im/fest">Fest</a>, which in turn was forked to create <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a>.
Thank you very much for all your work, Jonas!</p>

<p>A new addition to the website this week is the <a href="/contributing/">how to contribute</a> page, which offers an entry point for anyone interested in contributing to the project's software.
Thank you to everyone who has expressed interest in contributing in the past (and for everyone who will in the future!)
Hopefully this guide will help you get started and give you some ideas for how to help.</p>

<p>On several occasions I've been asked if there is a way to donate financially to the project.
I'm happy to report that Ruma now <a href="https://liberapay.com/ruma/">accepts donations via Liberapay</a>.
Donations to the project will be divided amongst team members, which as of today consists of only Jonas and me, but will hopefully grow over time.
In the past I was hesitant to accept donations because I didn't want financial interest to affect (or have the appearance of affecting) my decisions about the project.
I am building Ruma because I think the world needs Matrix, not as a way to support myself.
Being able to share donations to Ruma with other developers makes me much more comfortable with accepting donations.
It serves both to dilute my own financial interest in the project as well as to provide benefit in a way that's more in tune with the project's goals: making the world better for all of us.
For anyone that decides to support the project on Liberapay, I offer my most sincere thanks.</p>

<p>As for the software itself, the main update this week is that the revamp of ruma-events I've been working on for the past month is complete and has been merged into the master branch.
I still need to do one quick pass over everything to be sure I didn't make any obvious mistakes, but once that's done it will be ready for a new release.
As part of this revamp, a new supporting crate, <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events-macros">ruma-events-macros</a> also had its first release this week.
Like ruma-api-macros, it's really only used as an internal dependency for the project, and doesn't have much use to other developers directly.
But it could be interesting to look at if you want an example of a real-world procedural macro.</p>

<p>There was also a new release of ruma-api, <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-api/releases/tag/0.9.0">version 0.9.0</a>, which revises the API to support the upcoming futures 0.3, ironically by removing the dependency on futures entirely.
This release also removes the library's dependency on hyper, as it's always been a goal for the foundational Ruma libraries to allow other developers to build Matrix software with other HTTP libraries if they wish.</p>

<h2 id="matrix-at-large">Matrix at large</h2>

<p><a href="https://riot.im/">Riot</a>, the flagship Matrix client, <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/%EF%B8%8Fmessage-editing-%EF%B8%8F-reactions-5cffec8f71a2">released version 1.3</a> this week, which includes the ability to edit sent messages, and to add reactions to messages.
Both of these features are highly requested and bring Riot in line with other high-profile collaboration software.</p>

<p>Other notable news is the announcement to get <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>, a Matrix homeserver written in Go, into a state where it can have some practical use for Matrix users.
The first goal is for it to support enough functionality to be used for Matrix bots.
