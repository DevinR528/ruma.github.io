<p>Work continues on the major revamp of ruma-events <a href="/news/this-week-in-ruma-2019-06-23/">mentioned in the last update</a>.
Only a few modules remain to be converted to the new API.
It's not hard work, but it's a bit tedious, so I've been dragging on getting it done.
There are also a few modules that are somewhat blocked on <a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring/issues/859">an issue in <em>ring</em></a>.
Some of the types in ruma-events contain types from ruma-signatures which don't implement <code>Clone</code> and <code>PartialEq</code> because they contain types from <em>ring</em> which don't.
I want all event types in ruma-events to implement these traits.
I say this issue is "somewhat blocked" because I could always just modify ruma-events-macros to derive these traits conditionally and then just leave them out for the few types in question, but this would be an unfortunate workaround, so I'd prefer to have the issue solved upstream.
Unfortunately, the issue hasn't received a reply from any maintainers since I opened it a few weeks ago.
No hard feelingsâ€”that's how open source works sometimes.</p>

<h2 id="rust-at-large">Rust at large</h2>

<p>The big news in Rust since the last update is that <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/07/04/Rust-1.36.0.html">Rust 1.36 was released</a>, and it includes stabilization of the <code>Future</code> trait, one of the long-awaited building blocks for first-class async support in Rust.
As readers probably already know, the biggest reason for Ruma's development hiatus is waiting for async networking in Rust to mature, and this is one of the final pieces of foundational support we've been waiting for.
The remaining pieces are <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> syntax, which is expected in either the next version or the one following it, and finally, waiting for important libraries like Hyper and Tokio, as well as web frameworks, to adopt the new stuff.
I also consider <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2071">support for <code>impl Trait</code> in traits</a> to be an important feature that is not yet supported, but at this point Ruma doesn't seem to need this, so while it's a major missing component of Rust's async support, it doesn't seem likely to block Ruma development.</p>

<h2 id="from-the-editor">From the editor</h2>

<p>This week was spent working on a big revamp of <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events">ruma-events</a>, the library that defines Rust types for the "events" used in Matrix.
The previous week, I did a pass through the entire library to bring it up to date with version r0.5.0 of the Matrix specification.</p>

<p>After some discussion in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruma:matrix.org">#ruma:matrix.org</a>, I decided to make a move towards treating ruma-events as a higher-level library.
Previously, ruma-events has more or less offered Rust types that are exact representations of the JSON structures used by Matrix.
However, by representing events this way, it would be possible for users to easily create values that, while valid JSON, would be invalid events according to the specification.</p>

<p>The way we're approaching this problem is by separating serialization/deserialization of JSON from validation of events.
Rather than directly implementing <code>serde::Deserialize</code>, event types will be converted from a string of JSON data using <code>std::str::FromStr</code>.
This implementation will deserialize the data internally and then validate it, returning either a valid event, or a raw <code>serde_json::Value</code> along with an error message about why the event was invalid.
The latter form is necessary because invalid events will always be present in the Matrix system, created via bugs or other problems in homeserver implementations.
Once an event is in the event graph, other servers will receive these invalid events over federation, and must still persist them and deal with them as they are.</p>

<p>Similar to the new interface around deserialization, the serialized form of an event created by ruma-events may not directly match the structure of the Rust type.
ruma-events will instead expose variants of each event to ensure they can only be created in valid states.</p>

<p>To reduce the boilerplate that this approach necessarily causes (because for many events there will now be two structures: the public one and the private one used for converting to and from JSON), I started a new procedural macro, <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events-macros">ruma-events-macros</a>, to make the most common cases require minimal code in ruma-events.
It's been a lot of work, and there's still probably another week or more to go to finish implementing ruma-events using the new approach.
But when it's done, the result will be a Rust library for Matrix events that leaves less room for users to accidentally do the wrong thing, while also supporting interoperation with other Matrix software that isn't so strict.</p>

<p>Work is underway to bring Ruma up to date with <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0">version r0.5.0</a> of the Matrix specification.
Starting with the most foundational libraries and working up towards the higher-level ruma-client, this work should be done in the next week or two.
The bulk of the work since the last update has been on <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events">ruma-events</a>, adding all of the events that were previously missing, and doing a full pass through existing events to make sure our definitions match the specification.</p>

<p>In addition, community members Florian and Luca identified <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/issues/27">an issue</a> regarding the use of Rust's <code>u64</code> and <code>i64</code> for numeric values and potential interoperability problems with JavaScript.
After some discussion, Ruma team member jplatte created a new crate called <a href="https://github.com/jplatte/js_int">js_int</a> to address this.
It has already been integrated with ruma-client-api and ruma-events, and will be used for all integer values in Ruma from now on.</p>

A hearty congratulations to everyone who works on Matrix!
This is a huge milestone.
