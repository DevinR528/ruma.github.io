      %h2 What is Matrix?
      %p Matrix is an open specification for a next-generation chat platform. It includes all the features you'd expect from a modern chat platform including persistent history, offline messages, group chats, and end-to-end encryption for privacy and security. Matrix is federated, so no single company controls the system or your data. You can use an existing server you trust or run your own, and the servers synchronize messages seamlessly.
