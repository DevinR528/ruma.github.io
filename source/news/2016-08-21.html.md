**Ruma** is a homeserver for [Matrix](https://matrix.org) written in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.
Matrix is an open specification for an online communication protocol.
For an overview of the project, visit the [home page](/).
**This Week in Ruma** is a weekly summary of the development of Ruma, published on Sunday nights.

Apologies for the missed update last week!
I was sick and didn't get a chance to write it.
However, there was work on the project last week.
I will just include those changes in this update.

## Notable changes to [ruma](https://github.com/ruma/ruma)

* Previous work to update Diesel and Serde to the latest versions have been completed.
* Ruma now uses the types from [ruma-identifiers](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-identifiers) to represent Matrix IDs instead of strings.
* Ruma now uses the latest version of [ruma-events](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events) which also uses ruma-identifiers.
* The Docker Compose file now locks the Ruma development image to a specific version, so breaking changes to the image are now coordinated with Ruma.
  As part of the same change, the image is now locked to a specific version of the nightly compiler.

## Notable changes to [ruma-events](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events)

## Notable changes to [ruma-identifiers](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-identifiers)

* Crate version 0.3.0 was released, which implements `Clone` for the ID types and `Copy` for the error type.
* I'm working on a change that would allow the ID types to be used directly as struct fields for Diesel table types.
  Right now it seems like more trouble than it's worth, but I'm following the issue on [user-defined `FromSql`/`ToSql` types](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/348).

## Matrix at large

* [SPEC-442](https://matrix.org/jira/browse/SPEC-442): Explain requirements and guarantees around transaction IDs

## Rust at large

* Starting to think about how permissions checks will work in Ruma, I opened an issue for [transaction isolation support](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/408) in Diesel as a possible way to prevent ToCToU errors.
