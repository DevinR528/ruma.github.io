The Matrix protocol supports many features that any modern communication system should have.
Listed below are just a few of them.

* **Instant messaging.**
  Text chats, one-on-one with another person.
* **Group chats.**
  Text chats between multiple participants.
  Group chats can be public or private.
  They support all the features you'd expect from group chats, including invitations, topic messages, kicks/bans, and granular control over permissions.
* **Audio and video calls.**
  Matrix provides support for audio and video calls using VoIP technology.
* **Searchable message history.**
  Your homeserver stores a complete record of your communications and provides facilities to search your past conversations.
* **Synchronization across devices.**
  Use Matrix from your mobile phones, tablets, and computers.
  When you switch devices, you're right where you left off in all your conversations.
* **Push notifications.**
  Get a notification on your mobile device when you receive a message.
* **End-to-end encryption.**
  Instant messages and groups chats can be encrypted from end to end, meaning no one can read the contents of the messages, including the operators of your homeserver.
* **Media sharing.**
  Upload images, videos, documents, and other files to share with others.
* **User profiles.**
  Add information about yourself to your account, including an avatar that other people will see when they talk to you.
* **Typing notifications.**
  A notification appears in your client when someone is typing a message.
* **Read receipts.**
  Get confirmation that someone's read your messages.
* **Presences.**
