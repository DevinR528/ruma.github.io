`ruma-federation-api` contains serializable types for the requests and responses for each endpoint in the Matrix federation API.
It implements the generic interface for Matrix APIs defined in [ruma-api](/projects/ruma-api/).
`ruma-federation-api` allows the request and response types to be shared between [ruma](/projects/ruma/) and a potential future client library.
