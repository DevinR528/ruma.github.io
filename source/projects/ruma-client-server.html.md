`ruma-client-server` is the component of the Ruma homeserver that serves Matrix's client-server API.

`ruma-client-server` is intended for large-scale deployments when it is desirable to scale this component independently from the other components of the homeserver.
For small-scale deployments, it's easier to use the all-in-one `ruma` executable.
