title: Ruma - Projects
---

The Ruma project is more than just a Matrix homeserver.
It also includes libraries for writing Matrix-enabled software in the Rust programming language.
The goal of the project is to provide a rich ecosystem of tools for both homeserver operators and Rust developers.

The homeserver comes in two flavors:

* An all-in-one executable called `ruma` that contains the entire homeserver for small-scale deployments.
* A set of multiple executables for different components of the homeserver, so that they can be scaled independently for large-scale deployments.

The many libraries provided by the Ruma project are (or will be) released as [Rust crates](https://crates.io).
The Ruma applications eat their own dog food by consuming the Ruma libraries to provide some of their functionality.

Select an application or library from the menu to learn more about it and its place in the Ruma ecosystem.
